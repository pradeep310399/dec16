WINDOW HANDLES:
1.WHY SHOULD WE CONVERT SET INTO LIST IN WINDOWHANDLING?
 ANSWER:IN WINDOW HANDLING,IT RETURN AS SET BUT WE WANT SWITCH TO THE ANOTHER WE NEED AN INDEX VALUE.SET DOESNT ALLOWS THE INDEX VALUE,SO THAT WE CONVERT THE SET 
 INTO LIST.
 ALSO SET DOESNT ALLOWS THE DUPLICATES.
 
2.WE CAN HANDLES  THE  WINDOWS:
 IN TWO WAYS
  1)  -->String Win = name.get(index);
       driver.switchTo().window(Win);
	   
  2)  driver.switchTo().window(name.get(index))	;

3.FOR CLOSING THE BROWSER:
 
   --> DRIVER.CLOSE();--- CLOSES THE CURRENT WINDOW (WHICH WINDOW IS OPENS).
   --> DRIVER.QUIT();--- CLOSES ALL THE WINDOWS OPENED.
   
SCREENSHOT:
  METHOD USE TO TAKE SCREENSHOT 

             File screenShotAs = driver.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE); THIS METHOD RETURNS AS FILE TYPE
			  
			  
           	File target = new File(".\report\img.png"); USED TO SET THE PATH OF THE STORAGE
			
			FileUtils.CopyFile(ScreenshotAs,target);IT LINKS THE SOURCE AND TARGET FILES.
